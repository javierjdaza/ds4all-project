# Correlation One 
Data Science For All Cohort 2022

## Project Context: Marymount School

Identify those predictive factors of success and risk (“associated factors”) 
for the results of the Saber 11 tests of our students who are from sixth to eleventh 
grade of high school; where a predictive model can be developed in which the associated 
factors that may incur in the results of the Saber Tests can be identified in each cohort, 
taking into account all their academic grades, as well as the grades of the standardized tests they have taken.
